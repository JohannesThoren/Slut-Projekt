### my plan
my plan is to make some kind of portfolio for all of my programing stuff. it will include the following. 

* one part for all of my programs that i work on or that is finished.
* one part with info about myself.
* one part were i display all languages i know

if i have time i will also include a blog part on the site were i can write about stuff and talk about development. 

#### were to begin?
first i have to make a wireframe of some kind, for both back and front end. i want to go for a simple look, few colors, simple font just overall a simple and plain site. i also have to select a color scheme. 

This is the colorscheme that will be used (with some small changes)
